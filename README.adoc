= nvim-local-fennel

Run https://github.com/bakpakin/Fennel[Fennel] inside Neovim on startup with https://github.com/Olical/aniseed[Aniseed].

Add some Fennel code such as `(print "Hello, World!")` to a file named `.lnvim.fnl` in your current directory or anywhere above it such as your home directory. A file will be created beside the `.fnl` called `.lnvim.lua` which will be executed upon startup. Files higher up in your directory hierarchy, such as the home directory, will be executed before those found lower down, such as in a project.

Be sure to git ignore `.lnvim.fnl` _and_ `.lnvim.lua` if you don't want to share your local configuration with others. If you do want to share a `.lnvim.fnl` I'd recommend you ignore the `.lua` file to prevent duplicated changes in git commits.

Aniseed will only re-compile the Fennel code if it's changed since last time you opened Neovim. If you delete the `.lnvim.fnl` file then the `.lnvim.lua` file will be deleted automatically next time you launch Neovim to ensure you don't accidentally leave Lua files laying around.

== Installation

Use your favourite plugin manager, I highly recommend https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug[vim-plug] if you don't have one already. Be sure to pin it to a tag and subscribe to releases through GitHub.

[source,viml]
----
Plug 'Olical/nvim-local-fennel', { 'tag': 'v2.9.0' }
Plug 'Olical/aniseed'
----

If you want interactive evaluation of the forms in your `.lnvim.fnl` file you can install https://github.com/Olical/conjure[Conjure] too.

== Access to Aniseed

Aniseed is embedded under the `nvim-local-fennel.aniseed.*` module prefix, this means you can use Aniseed's macros and functions in your `.lnvim.fnl` files!

[source,clojure]
----
;; .lnvim.fnl
;; You can give the module any name you want.
(module my-local-fennel
  {autoload {a nvim-local-fennel.aniseed.core
             str nvim-local-fennel.aniseed.string
             nvim nvim-local-fennel.aniseed.nvim}})

;; A hyphen suffix denotes a private function.
(defn- do-some-things [numbers]
  (a.println
    (nvim.fn.getcwd)
    (a.map a.inc numbers)
    {:Hello :Fennel!}))

;; Public value.
;; You could require this module and access it.
(def counting [1 2 3])

;; Executed as the file is loaded.
