= nvim-local-fennel

Run https://github.com/bakpakin/Fennel[Fennel] inside Neovim on startup with https://github.com/Olical/aniseed[Aniseed].

Add some Fennel code such as `(print "Hello, World!")` to a file named `.lnvim.fnl` in your current directory or anywhere above it such as your home directory. A file will be created beside the `.fnl` called `.lnvim.lua` which will be executed upon startup. Files higher up in your directory hierarchy, such as the home directory, will be executed before those found lower down, such as in a project.

Be sure to git ignore `.lnvim.fnl` _and_ `.lnvim.lua` if you don't want to share your local configuration with others. If you do want to share a `.lnvim.fnl` I'd recommend you ignore the `.lua` file to prevent duplicated changes in git commits.

Aniseed will only re-compile the Fennel code if it's changed since last time you opened Neovim. If you delete the `.lnvim.fnl` file then the `.lnvim.lua` file will be deleted automatically next time you launch Neovim to ensure you don't accidentally leave Lua files laying around.

== Installation

If you want interactive evaluation of the forms in your `.lnvim.fnl` file you can install https://github.com/Olical/conjure[Conjure] too.

== Access to Aniseed

Aniseed is embedded under the `nvim-local-fennel.aniseed.*` module prefix, this means you can use Aniseed's macros and functions in your `.lnvim.fnl` files!
